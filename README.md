## About

This is a small single page application I built that can be used to organize trades of Magic: The Gathering cards. Magic is a collectible card game and I'll often see people writing down lists of cards and doing math with pen and paper.

I use the [deckbrew API](https://deckbrew.com/api/) to get official card information. Unfortunately the pricing information from deckbrew is no longer functional, so the user must enter their valuation of cards manually.

## Live site

There is a personal, low-capacity hosting of Traderakul [here](http://traderakul.herokuapp.com/).
